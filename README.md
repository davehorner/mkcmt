## Overview

This tool generates concise or lengthy, Conventional Commit-compatible commit messages using GPT-4o-mini (ChatGPT), based on your Git diff outputs. It intelligently handles both staged and unstaged changes, progressively refining commit suggestions based on user feedback, and can copy the final commit message directly to your clipboard.

## Features

- **Intelligent Commit Message Generation:** Leverages AI to analyze Git diffs and generate clear, descriptive commit messages.
- **Interactive Refinement:** If the initial suggestion isn't suitable, the tool progressively refines the prompt to generate better commit messages.
- **Clipboard Integration:** Offers the convenience of copying commit messages directly to the clipboard.
- **Recovery Mode:** Use the `-r` or `--recovery` flag to extract the previous commit message from `HEAD@{1}` and copy it directly to your system clipboard.
- **Soft Reset Mode:** Use the `-s` or `--soft-reset` flag to perform a soft reset on the current branch, enabling you to amend the last commit without losing changes.
- **Display Current Commit:** Use the `-c` or `--current` flag to display the current (last) commit message for review.
- **Detailed Logging:** Maintains logs of both generated commit messages and refined prompts for easy reference.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo installed
- Access to the GPT-4o-mini model (requires an OpenAI API key)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/davehorner/mkcmt.git
cd mkcmt
cargo install --path .
```


2. **Set API Key**

Set your OpenAI API key in the environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```


## Usage

run mkcmt in a git folder with some changes.  follow the prompts.

```
mkcmt -h
mkcmt is make commit.  Conventional Commit Generator

Usage: mkcmt [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -r, --recovery    Activate recovery mode to restore a previous commit message (from HEAD@{1})
  -s, --soft-reset  Perform a soft reset on the current branch
  -c, --current     Display the current (last) commit message
  -h, --help        Print help
  -V, --version     Print version
```

### Workflow:

- The tool checks for both staged (`git diff --cached`) and unstaged (`git diff`) changes.
- Prompts whether to combine staged and unstaged changes if both exist.
- Queries ChatGPT for a suitable commit message based on the provided diff.
- Presents the commit message and prompts for acceptance.
  - If accepted, optionally copies it to the clipboard.
  - If declined, GPT is used iteratively to refine the prompt until an acceptable commit message is produced.

_The iterative refinement and nice initial prompts are TBD (To Be Developed).  What you get now might not be as good as `giff diff --cached | (clip|pbcopy)` taken straight to consumer
ChatGPT interface.  This is v0.2.1; expect simple._

## Output Logs

The tool maintains two log files for transparency and auditing purposes: 
   
- `cc` stands for conventional commit

- `output_cc_suggestions.txt`
  - Logs each generated commit message, clearly separated.

- `output_cc_prompts.txt`
  - Logs each refined prompt used for subsequent message generation.

The logs are continually appended with clear separators, facilitating easy review and continuous improvement.

## Requirements

- Rust
- OPENAI_API_KEY key for GPT-4o-mini accessible via your environment.
- git must be installed and accessible via command line.


## Example

```
$ cargo run
Both staged and unstaged changes detected.
Include both staged and unstaged changes in commit message? (y/n): y

Querying ChatGPT for commit message...

Suggested commit message:
feat: implement interactive AI-powered commit message generation tool

Accept this commit message? (y/n): n
Refining prompt for a better commit message...

Querying ChatGPT again with refined prompt...

Suggested commit message:
feat: add interactive refinement for better commit message accuracy based on user feedback

Accept this commit message? (y/n): y

Copy commit message to clipboard? (y/n): y
Commit message copied to clipboard.
```

### Commit Message Recovery Note

When developing a new feature, it is essential to adhere to conventional commit standards. I employ `mkcmt` to ensure that commit messages conform to these conventions. However, there are instances where it becomes necessary to undo a commit generated for `release-plz update`â€”for example, when modifications to the CHANGELOG or other adjustments are required. In such cases, the originally intended commit message may be lost. The recovery mode in `mkcmt` (activated with the `-r` flag) facilitates the restoration of this commit message from `HEAD@{1}` by copying it to the clipboard, thereby preserving the original message for future use.
